# Design Patterns:

Typical solutions to common problems
in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint
that you can customize to solve a particular
design problem in your code.<br>
All patterns can be categorized by their intent, or purpose<br>

**1. Creational patterns:** provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

**2. Structural patterns:** explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

**3. Behavioral patterns:** take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

## A. Structural Patterns:-

### Adapter Pattern :

1.  The adapter pattern is a great pattern for connecting new code to legacy code without having to change the working contract that was produced from the legacy code originally.
2.  Allow object with incompatible interfaces to collaborate<br><br>
    <b>Problem Was :<b> 1. Can’t reuse class that doesn’t have an interface that the client want 2. Classes that have incompatible interface can’t work together
